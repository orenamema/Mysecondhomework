My second homework 



I am going to create a Portfolio using Bootstrap. The first thing that I do is create a HTML file for the about page which will be the main page and 2 others for the Portfolio and the Contact. The objective of this assignment is to make sure that the website is compatible on Mobile devices such as a cell phone or a tablet. Bootstrap gives us the tools to make the website compatible on mobile devices. 



Page #1 About 

To create the About page Iâ€™ve used the Navabar for the top container. Using Bootstrap we can use a template on the website which allows us to work faster. In addition of Bootstrap, I will be using style.css to edit the format of the Navbar.

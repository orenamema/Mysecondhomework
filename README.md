My second homework 



I am going to create a Portfolio using Bootstrap. The first thing that I do is create a HTML file for the about page which will be the main page and 2 others for the Portfolio and the Contact. The objective of this assignment is to make sure that the website is compatible on Mobile devices such as a cell phone or a tablet. Bootstrap gives us the tools to make the website compatible on mobile devices. 



Page #1 About 

To create the About page Iâ€™ve used the Navabar for the top container. Using Bootstrap we can use a template on the website which allows us to work faster. In addition of Bootstrap, I will be using style.css to edit the format of the Navbar.



Page #2 Portfolio 





Page #3 Contact

# access the folder
cd qlearncatchd3/
# build the container
docker build -t viz_server node_container
# run the container
docker run -it -p 80:80 -p 2814:2814 viz_server node viz_server.js debug

## 3 - Get local IP addres and build-run the qlearning app
Get IP adddress for [windows](https://kb.wisc.edu/page.php?id=27309) with `ipconfig /all`.
For Unix systems use `ifconfig`
An example of this can be 10.227.40.281

Open another command line window
```Bash
# assuming one is still in the repository folder 
# build the container qlearncatchd3
docker build -t qlearnin qlearn_container
# run the container
# docker run -it qlearnin python test_catch.py <game> <ip_address> <debug_optional> <node_optional> <count_of_epoch_optional>
docker run -it qlearnin python test_catch.py Catch 10.227.40.281 debug with_node 1000
```

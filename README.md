Using bootstrap to create a Portfolio website 

## Intro

This is a simple Portfolio website that can be accessed at [index.html](index.htlm).
The objective of this assignment is to make sure that the website is compatible on Mobile devices such as a cell phone or a tablet. Bootstrap gives us the tools to make the website compatible on mobile devices. 

There are 3 pages:
* `About`: My description
* `Portfolio`: The portfolio I will build
* `Contact`: How to get in touch with me
